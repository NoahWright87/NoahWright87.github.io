# Noah Wright's Developer Site
This repo holds the code used to build the site at [NoahWright.dev](https://noahwright.dev/).  This is both my own area to play around with web technologies and a way to show off the things I've been working on.

## 💻 Technology Used
- React + Bootstrap site, hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)
- Resume generated from JSON file
- Axios to call an ASP.NET webservice to email/text me

## 🚧 Work in Progress
I have a full time software engineer job, I'm in the Air Force Reserves, and I have a wife and kids.  I don't have a ton of free time, but when I do, I tinker with this site.  Check back occasionally to see what I've been up to!

### 🥳 Most Recent Changes
From newest to oldest:
- Contact Me form now works, will send an email and text to me without revealing my phone number/email address.
- Removed the *Future Changes* section below, added those as Issues on GitHub.
- Update Portfolio page to have some old Unity-based games and my current GitHub project: Level Up Learning.
